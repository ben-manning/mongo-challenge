1. Step one, enter 'mongod' into one terminal window and use 'mongo' in the second terminal window
2. Type help is good for finding commands
3. Typing 'use <blank>' creates and names the db in mongo terminal.
4. The return will be <blank>.show (the use command will also switch between db's).


### If you enter the wrong information when doing a query the return will be blank.
### 'show dbs' will show all of your databases in MongoDB.
### 'show collections' will show all of your collections in MongoDB.


## Move step three of the beginning of the basic challenges to the beginning of the notes
